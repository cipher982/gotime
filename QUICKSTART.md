# Gotime MVP - Quick Start Guide

## Prerequisites
- **Must be inside a Git repository** - gotime uses git worktrees
- tmux installed (`brew install tmux` on macOS)
- Basic familiarity with tmux (Ctrl-b is the prefix key)

## Git Repository Requirement

Gotime **must** be run from within a git repository because it:
- Creates git worktrees (isolated copies of your repo)
- Creates feature branches
- Manages git commits and pushes

If you try to run it outside a git repo, you'll see:
```
Error: Not in a git repository!
Please run gotime from within a git repository.
```

## Installation (30 seconds)

```bash
# Option 1: Add to PATH (recommended)
sudo ln -s $(pwd)/gotime.sh /usr/local/bin/gotime

# Option 2: Create alias
echo "alias gotime='$(pwd)/gotime.sh'" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Basic Usage

### 1. Start a session
```bash
gotime start login-ui payment-api
```

This will:
- Create 2 git worktrees in `/tmp/gotime_sessions/`
- Create branches: `feature/login-ui-XXXXX` and `feature/payment-api-XXXXX`
- Open tmux with 2 panes side by side
- Each pane is in its own isolated git worktree

### 2. Work in parallel
- Left pane: Work on login-ui feature
- Right pane: Work on payment-api feature
- Use any AI coding assistant in each pane
- Make commits normally with `git add` and `git commit`

### 3. End session
```bash
# First, detach from tmux: Ctrl-b then d
gotime end
```

This will:
- Show commits made in each branch
- Ask if you want to push branches (for PR creation)
- Offer to clean up the worktrees

## Tmux Basics

- **Switch panes**: `Ctrl-b` then arrow keys
- **Detach session**: `Ctrl-b` then `d`
- **Scroll mode**: `Ctrl-b` then `[` (exit with `q`)
- **Kill pane**: `Ctrl-b` then `x`

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start working on two features
$ gotime start user-profile search-feature

# 2. In left pane (user-profile)
$ echo "Working on user profile"
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Add user profile component"

# 3. Switch to right pane (Ctrl-b â†’)
$ echo "Working on search"
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Implement search algorithm"

# 4. Detach when done (Ctrl-b d)

# 5. End session and create PRs
$ gotime end
```

## Tips

1. **Feature names**: Use short, descriptive names without spaces
2. **Commits**: Make regular commits in each pane
3. **AI assistants**: Run your AI tool (Cursor, Cline, etc.) in each pane independently
4. **Multiple sessions**: Only one session at a time is supported in this MVP

## Troubleshooting

### "No active gotime session found"
- You may have already ended the session
- Check if session file exists: `ls ~/.gotime_session`

### Tmux session already exists
- Kill existing session: `tmux kill-session -t gotime_XXXXX`
- List sessions: `tmux ls`

### Worktree errors
- List worktrees: `git worktree list`
- Remove stuck worktree: `git worktree remove /tmp/gotime_sessions/... --force`

### Can't push branches
- Make sure you have commits: `git log --oneline`
- Check remote: `git remote -v`
- Manual push: `git push origin feature/name-XXXXX`

## What's Next?

Once comfortable with this MVP:
1. Try working on 2 related features that share code
2. Use different AI models in each pane
3. Time how much faster you can develop in parallel
